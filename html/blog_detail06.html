						Meanwhile, WFP President Suk Sub Shim also announced that they are also excited to expand their branch network within the next 5 years. “Currently, we will be opening another branch in Sta. Rosa, Laguna to serve our growing number of customers in the South Luzon area. We are also planning to put up more branches in the next 5 years in strategic areas all over the Philippines which will eventually position WFP as the preferred financial services company in the coming years.”
						Michael Macalinao, WFP Pampanga Branch Manager, assured their existing and future customers that they will deliver the most reliable and world-class financial services in the Central Luzon region. “We are now aggressively expanding and accepting loan applications particularly from provinces from Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. We do hope that WFP Pampanga will help their preferred financial service provider in our area”, said Macalinao.
